description: Deploys a PolicyEngine dashboard to Vercel (and optionally Modal) and registers it in the app
---

# Deploying dashboard: $ARGUMENTS

Deploy a completed PolicyEngine dashboard to production. Run this AFTER merging your feature branch into `main`.

**Precondition:** The user should be on the `main` branch with a clean working tree and the dashboard code merged.

## Skills Used

- **policyengine-vercel-deployment-skill** — Frontend deployment (all dashboards)
- **policyengine-modal-deployment-skill** — Backend deployment (only if `custom-backend` pattern)

## Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

```bash
# Check we're on main
git branch --show-current

# Check for clean working tree
git status

# Verify build passes
bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run build && bunx vitest run
```

**If not on main:** Tell the user to merge their feature branch first:
> You're currently on branch `{branch}`. Please merge into `main` first:
> ```bash
> git checkout main
> git merge {branch}
> git push
> ```
> Then run `/deploy-dashboard` again.

**If build fails:** Report the error and STOP. Do not deploy broken code.

## Step 2: Read the Plan

```bash
cat plan.yaml
```

Extract:
- `dashboard.name` — for Vercel project and Modal app names
- `dashboard.zone_path` — for multi-zone host rewrite verification
- `data_pattern` — determines if Modal deploy is needed (`custom-backend` vs `api-v2-alpha`)
- `tech_stack.framework` — should be `react-nextjs` (env var prefix: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`)
- `embedding.register_in_apps_json` — determines if apps.json update is needed
- `embedding.slug` — the URL slug for policyengine.org

### 2a. Pre-flight: check for existing host rewrites (informational)

If this dashboard has deployed before, the host (`policyengine-app-v2/website/next.config.ts`) may already have rewrites pointing at it. Check so we know whether Step 5 needs to add them or they're already in place.

```bash
# Clone or pull the host repo
if [ ! -d /tmp/policyengine-app-v2 ]; then
  gh repo clone PolicyEngine/policyengine-app-v2 /tmp/policyengine-app-v2
fi
(cd /tmp/policyengine-app-v2 && git checkout main && git pull)

# Invoke the multi-zone validator in host-only mode to check all rewrite structure at once
# (beforeFiles placement, route + asset rewrite counts, destination format)
```

Spawn the `multizone-validator` agent with `TARGET_PATH=.` (current dashboard repo) and `HOST_CONFIG_PATH=/tmp/policyengine-app-v2/website/next.config.ts`. Record which host-check items PASS / FAIL — these feed into Step 5 below.

**Do NOT stop if host rewrites are missing.** For a brand-new dashboard, the host can't have rewrites yet because Vercel hasn't assigned a production URL. Step 5 handles adding them **after** the first deploy captures the URL.

## Step 3: Deploy Backend (if custom-backend)

**Only if `data_pattern: custom-backend`.** If `api-v2-alpha`, skip to Step 4.

See `policyengine-modal-deployment-skill` for the full Modal deployment reference.

### 3a. Authentication check (human gate)

```bash
modal token info
modal profile list
```

Present the output to the user. Verify:
- Active profile is `policyengine`
- Workspace is `policyengine`

**If authentication fails or shows wrong workspace:** Stop and display instructions:

> **Modal authentication required.** Your CLI is not configured for the `policyengine` workspace.
>
> Please run:
> ```bash
> modal token new --profile policyengine
> modal profile activate policyengine
> ```
>
> If you don't have access, ask a PolicyEngine workspace owner for an invite.

**Do NOT proceed until `modal token info` shows `Workspace: policyengine`.**

**If authentication succeeds**, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm before proceeding:

```
question: "Modal is authenticated to the policyengine workspace. Proceed with deployment?"
header: "Modal auth"
options:
  - label: "Proceed"
    description: "Continue to environment selection and deploy"
  - label: "Cancel"
    description: "Stop deployment"
```

### 3b. Environment selection (human gate)

Use `AskUserQuestion` to select the Modal environment:

```
question: "Which Modal environment should this deploy to?"
header: "Environment"
options:
  - label: "main (Recommended)"
    description: "Production — policyengine--app-func.modal.run"
  - label: "staging"
    description: "Pre-production testing — policyengine-staging--app-func.modal.run"
  - label: "testing"
    description: "Development/CI — policyengine-testing--app-func.modal.run"
```

### 3c. Deploy

```bash
# Guard against env var override
unset MODAL_TOKEN_ID MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET

# Deploy to the selected environment
modal deploy modal_app.py --env SELECTED_ENV
```

### 3d. Verify endpoint

Construct the URL from the app name and function name in `modal_app.py`:

- Pattern: `https://policyengine--APP_NAME-FUNCTION_NAME.modal.run`
- With non-main environment: `https://policyengine-ENV--APP_NAME-FUNCTION_NAME.modal.run`

```bash
# Health check (if endpoint exists)
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" https://policyengine--DASHBOARD_NAME-health.modal.run

# Test the calculation endpoint
curl -s -X POST https://policyengine--DASHBOARD_NAME-calculate.modal.run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
```

**If deploy fails:** Report error and STOP. See the `policyengine-modal-deployment-skill` troubleshooting table.

### 3e. Set API URL in Vercel

After successful Modal deploy, set the API URL as a Vercel environment variable.

```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production
# Enter: https://policyengine--DASHBOARD_NAME-calculate.modal.run
```

## Step 4: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

See `policyengine-vercel-deployment-skill` for the full Vercel deployment reference.

```bash
# Link to Vercel under PolicyEngine team (if not already linked)
vercel link --scope policy-engine

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod --yes --scope policy-engine
```

If a Modal backend was deployed in Step 3, force-rebuild to pick up the new env var:
```bash
vercel --prod --force --yes --scope policy-engine
```

Capture the production URL from the output.

Verify the deployment:
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://VERCEL_PRODUCTION_URL/
```

**IMPORTANT:** Use the auto-assigned Vercel production URL, not a custom alias. Custom aliases may have deployment protection issues.

## Step 5: Wire the zone into the host (policyengine-app-v2)

After the Vercel deploy in Step 4, we have a production URL. Now wire the zone into `policyengine-app-v2` so it's reachable at `policyengine.org/<zone_path>`. This is a PR to `PolicyEngine/policyengine-app-v2`.

Two parts, both in the same PR:

1. **Host rewrites** — required for every multi-zone dashboard. These make the zone reachable at `policyengine.org/<zone_path>`.
2. **apps.json entry** — optional, only if `embedding.register_in_apps_json: true`. This is research-listing metadata; it does NOT affect routing.

### 5a. Create the PR branch

```bash
# Clone app-v2 if not already available
if [ ! -d /tmp/policyengine-app-v2 ]; then
  gh repo clone PolicyEngine/policyengine-app-v2 /tmp/policyengine-app-v2
fi

cd /tmp/policyengine-app-v2
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b wire-DASHBOARD_NAME-zone
```

### 5b. Add host rewrites to `website/next.config.ts`

Add these entries to `rewrites().beforeFiles` in `website/next.config.ts` (use `VERCEL_PRODUCTION_URL` captured from Step 4 — e.g. `my-dashboard-policy-engine.vercel.app`):

```ts
// Two route rewrites (always required for zones with basePath)
{ source: '<zone_path>',        destination: 'https://<VERCEL_PRODUCTION_URL><zone_path>' },
{ source: '<zone_path>/:path*', destination: 'https://<VERCEL_PRODUCTION_URL><zone_path>/:path*' },

// Asset rewrite (required for static-export zones using assetPrefix: '/_zones/<dashboard.name>')
{ source: '/_zones/<dashboard.name>/:path*', destination: 'https://<VERCEL_PRODUCTION_URL>/_zones/<dashboard.name>/:path*' },
```

Skip the asset rewrite if `output: 'export'` is not set in the zone's `next.config`. Skip both route rewrites if the zone uses the "serves-at-root" pattern (no basePath) — adjust rewrites to map `<zone_path>` → root of the zone instead. See `policyengine-interactive-tools-skill` for the three valid patterns.

### 5c. Add apps.json entry (only if `embedding.register_in_apps_json: true`)

This is research-listing metadata. The dashboard is reachable at `policyengine.org/<zone_path>` from Step 5b alone; this entry adds it to the research/interactives listing.

Add to `app/src/data/apps/apps.json`:

```json
{
  "slug": "SLUG",
  "title": "TITLE",
  "description": "DESCRIPTION",
  "path": "/COUNTRY/SLUG",
  "tags": ["COUNTRY", "policy", "interactives"],
  "countryId": "COUNTRY",
  "displayWithResearch": true,
  "image": "SLUG-cover.png",
  "date": "CURRENT_DATE 12:00:00",
  "authors": ["AUTHOR_SLUG"]
}
```

The `path` field is the multi-zone route on `policyengine.org` (the host rewrites from 5b make it reachable). Do not use `"type": "iframe"` — that's the legacy embedding model and does not apply to multi-zone deployments.

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather required metadata:

```
question: "What is the author slug for the apps.json entry? (Check existing entries in apps.json for format, e.g., 'max-ghenis')"
header: "Author"
options: [] (free text — let the user type via "Other")
```

If `displayWithResearch: true`, also ask:

```
question: "Do you have a cover image for the apps.json listing?"
header: "Cover image"
options:
  - label: "I'll provide one"
    description: "You'll give me the image file or path"
  - label: "Skip for now"
    description: "Use a placeholder — you can add a cover image later"
```

### 5d. Commit and open the PR

```bash
git add website/next.config.ts app/src/data/apps/apps.json  # second path only if 5c ran
git commit -m "Wire DASHBOARD_NAME zone"
git push -u origin wire-DASHBOARD_NAME-zone

gh pr create --repo PolicyEngine/policyengine-app-v2 \
  --title "Wire DASHBOARD_NAME zone" \
  --body "Adds host rewrites (and apps.json entry, if applicable) so DASHBOARD_NAME is reachable at policyengine.org/COUNTRY/SLUG.

Zone URL: VERCEL_PRODUCTION_URL
Public path: /COUNTRY/SLUG"
```

## Step 6: Smoke Test

Direct-URL checks can run immediately. Public-path checks require the Step 5 PR to merge first.

Immediate (after Step 4):

1. **Direct zone URL:** Visit `https://VERCEL_PRODUCTION_URL/<zone_path>`, verify the dashboard loads
2. **Hash sync:** Test that URL parameters work (add `#income=50000` etc.) and survive refresh
3. **Country detection (if supported):** Test with `#country=uk`

After Step 5 PR merges:

4. **Public path via host:** Verify the dashboard loads at `policyengine.org/COUNTRY/SLUG` (served through host rewrites, not an iframe)
5. **Assets load:** Open DevTools → Network, refresh, confirm all `_next/static/*` assets return 200. For static-export zones, verify `/_zones/<dashboard.name>/*` requests reach the zone.
6. **Shared chrome (if using ui-kit):** Verify Header/Footer render consistently with the rest of `policyengine.org`

## Step 7: Report

Present deployment summary to the user:

> ## Dashboard deployed
>
> - **Zone URL:** VERCEL_PRODUCTION_URL
> - **Public path (after host PR merges):** policyengine.org/COUNTRY/SLUG
> - **Vercel project:** DASHBOARD_NAME
> [If custom backend:]
> - **API endpoint:** https://policyengine--DASHBOARD_NAME-calculate.modal.run
> - **Modal environment:** SELECTED_ENV
> - **Host-wiring PR:** PR_URL (adds rewrites, and apps.json entry if applicable)
>
> ### Verify
> - [ ] Dashboard loads at the zone URL
> - [ ] Calculations work (or stubs respond correctly)
> - [ ] Hash parameters are preserved on refresh
> - [ ] After host-wiring PR merges, dashboard loads at policyengine.org/COUNTRY/SLUG
> - [ ] After host-wiring PR merges, assets (`_next/static/*`) load with 200 status
