# Claude Code launcher: review-program

Read the canonical [workflow.md](workflow.md) first. This adapter maps its operations
to Claude Code; it adds no review stages or completion gates.

- **Arguments**: preserve positional arguments and flags, including `--sources` and
  `--source-budget`, according to the canonical grammar.
- **Entrypoint**: this workflow is registered as a skill, without a same-named command
  stub. Check that Skill returns this entrypoint and resolve `REVIEW_SKILL_ROOT` from its
  reported base directory. Pass that path to workers; never use a filesystem-wide search
  or recursive Skill invocation to recover a compatibility stub.
- **Questions**: use `AskUserQuestion` for missing/ambiguous PR identity or a posting
  decision. Honor decisions already provided; review can finish before asking to post.
- **Delegation**: launch `general-purpose` agents for the canonical `policy-reviewer`
  and `code-reviewer` in one parallel tool batch as soon as the snapshot exists, before writing the scope
  brief; send the brief's questions afterwards with `SendMessage`. Use the active
  `Agent`/delegation tool's actual schema; do not pass `run_in_background` or `team_name`
  unless it supports them. Each prompt includes its full canonical task, exact
  snapshot/diff/PR-body/report paths, its progress-log path, concrete `WORKTREE_ROOT`,
  `WORKTREE_ID`, `RUN_ROOT`, `PREFIX`, `SNAPSHOT`, source budget, the context rules
  (grep extracts, one test invocation, summary-only test output) and `Load skills:`
  entries. Resolve installed skill names by suffix, never by assuming the `complete:`
  namespace.
- **Model-development loading**: country-model reviewers invoke the resolved installed
  skill with the `Skill` tool in their own context, then read the relevant references.
  Require canonical `SKILLS_READY` evidence before accepting their work. A worker without
  Skill access or the required installed skill returns `SKILLS_BLOCKED`; the skill list
  in its prompt is not proof of loading.
- **Agent contracts**: use these general-purpose agents rather than specialized
  document-collector/program-reviewer/validator agents whose standalone routines add
  overlapping work. Reviewers do not create nested teams or delegate verification.
  Do not require `TeamCreate`; use it only if available and required by that runtime.
- **Completion**: wait for background completion notifications. The only file the
  coordinator watches is each role's `{PREFIX}-review-progress-{role}.log`: check it when a
  sibling completes, or use `Monitor` with an until-loop on its modification time for a
  bounded wait. Silence over five minutes: `SendMessage` the role "finalize now with what
  you have"; two more minutes: `TaskStop` it and apply the canonical recovery. Never treat
  a partial report as finished. The coordinator reads the reports and writes both final
  outputs. Use completion notifications; do not implement waits with multi-minute shell
  sleeps. The liveness threshold is not the polling interval.
- **Adjudication**: only for the specific material uncertainty allowed in Phase 5,
  launch a general-purpose agent with the remaining source budget and the disputed
  question. No automatic verifier per finding, source, page or parameter.
- **Coordinator reads**: the diff, code, source evidence and findings are available
  to the coordinator as needed. There is no summary-only context restriction here. Before
  assembly, open each CRITICAL's evidence artifact once, per the canonical Phase 5 check.
