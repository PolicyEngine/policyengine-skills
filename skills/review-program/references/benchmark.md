# Evaluating workflow changes on real PRs

For maintainers changing review-program, not for reviewers during an ordinary run.
The acceptance evidence for review behavior is a real PR run. Python tests are a separate
check of the helpers: commit isolation, subprocess termination, evidence integrity, and
the report status consumed by encode-policy-v2. They cannot establish policy accuracy.

## Run and assess

Choose a real PR that exercises the behavior being changed. Record the repository,
captured head and merge base, workflow revision (and local diff if uncommitted), source
cache state/budget, and available model environment. Keep reviews local unless posting
is explicitly authorized. A changed remote PR head is a different benchmark input.

Run the actual workflow through review, consolidation and cleanup. Give reviewers the
PR and primary evidence, without prior findings or expected answers. For an agent-based
evaluation, use a fresh context. An artifact replay measures helper performance only;
it does not count as a new workflow review.

After completion, assess the findings against the code, primary sources and plausible
inputs. Record:

- Confirmed defects and material misses, including the final affected result.
- False positives, withdrawn findings and unsupported assumptions.
- Evidence gaps and checks not executed, even when no defects were found.
- End-to-end time and where it went: overlapping reviewer work, source acquisition,
  test execution/startup, duplicated work, consolidation and cleanup.

Keep raw reports and timings under RUN_ROOT. Record corrections alongside the original
result so a fast run with an invalid finding is not presented as a success. A passing
test suite or a previous review is not the expected-policy oracle. Known findings are
useful checks, not proof that every remaining defect has been found.

Compare workflow versions on the same captured code with comparable environment and
cache conditions before claiming a speed improvement. Assess the changed behavior,
not a fixed number of PRs or a growing mandatory scenario matrix. If no such run has
been completed, label the behavior/runtime effect **not yet benchmarked**.

## Existing real-run evidence

These are historical observations, not a controlled before/after comparison. They used
different PRs and workflow revisions. Preserve their original local reports when reusing
them; do not supply this evaluator table to a reviewer as an answer key.

| PR / captured head | What the experiment established | Recorded active runtime |
|---|---|---|
| PolicyEngine/policyengine-us #9393 / `4a94246b54496ff79588d2c1ea1cf5064f058122` | Intermediate retirement eligibility did not reach the final subtraction; exact indexed-cap evidence remained a gap. | 10m56s |
| PolicyEngine/policyengine-us #9345 / `857d7c76e5074961cce13bb04462f84fb6b263ee` | The SSI cash-cessation finding was withdrawn: its inputs did not establish that disability ceased. This is a false-positive example, not a defect to rediscover. | 10m36s, excluding later correction |
| PolicyEngine/policyengine-us #9379 / `e1b168d7d1ef3ffc52442ec511cef11765751afe` | Final eligibility checks found the omitted student exclusion and mismatched couple income unit despite passing changed tests. | 9m49s |

Reassembling #9379's saved report in approximately 0.05s validated the assembler's
mechanics. It did not measure the time to choose findings or establish their correctness.
The current local orchestration edits need their own real-run evidence.

## MO LIHEAP workflow correction, September 2026

The local encoding benchmark at `8a084efa3d948585786a4e13b368ac594942548c`
used the PR #88 workflow plus local-diff and skill-loading changes. Its two reviews
took approximately 30m21s and 26m06s after subtracting long event gaps correlated with
machine sleep (actual wall times 78m09s and 42m39s). Individual reviewers took 9–14
minutes; setup, staggered dispatch and roughly nine minutes of post-reviewer work
accounted for the rest. These adjusted times are estimates, not active-compute measurements.

The run exposed duplicate skill/command entrypoints, verbose report reconciliation,
unverified applicant premises counted as critical, and ordinary limitations classified
as missing required checks. The subsequent workflow correction has this bounded evidence:

- A fresh native Claude entrypoint smoke test loaded both real skills and their canonical
  paths in 23.8s, with no compatibility stub or recursive invocation.
- Replaying the existing MO reports through the assembler took 0.05–0.08s and produced
  a 20-line summary while preserving full evidence. Marking C3 UNVERIFIED excluded it
  from `confirmed_critical_ids` without dropping it from total open findings.
- A fresh context loaded review-program and model-development and evaluated C3 from
  the existing claim, primary-source excerpt and recorded diagnostic inputs/outputs.
  In 76.1s it rejected automatic repair because the applicant premise was unestablished.
  It also volunteered unsupported side remarks about the senior branch and proposed
  fallback. Those remarks were rejected, and the adjudication instruction was narrowed
  afterwards. An earlier packet accidentally omitted relevant evidence and is excluded
  from acceptance evidence.

These checks validate entrypoint resolution, assembly mechanics and one bounded
scenario decision. They do **not** establish full-review accuracy, successful parallel
dispatch under load, or a new end-to-end runtime. The final narrowed adjudication wording
and overall latency still need the next real-PR benchmark. Do not report replay time as
review time or this scenario check as a third MO review.
